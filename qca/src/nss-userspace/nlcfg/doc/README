NETLINK Configuration Utility
=============================
The tool is used for configuring the NSS using the NETLINK channel. But, it
can be ported to any other communication channel between user and kernel

The use case for using the utility is to statically program rules in NSS such
that it accelerates them inside the NSS. Typically, this would be done by the
ECM (Enhanced Connection Manager) for use cases where acceleration is required
automatically. For certain use cases where the flows are known and programming
them is through a secure and controlled interface such an arrangement will make
sense.

The programming of the configuration is typically done for the following
components as of now
1). IPv4
2). IPv6

1) General organization
======================
The organization of the commands are categorized into a family, command & sub
parameters.

1.1)family
==========
The parameter "family=" selects the command family type e.g., IPv4,
IPv6 etc. To dump the available families type "usr/sbin/nlcfg".

Example type the following to get the dump of the supported families

$usr/sbin/nlcfg
[OPT_1]'family=ipv4'
[OPT_2]'family=ipv6'

type this to select the family
$usr/sbin/nlcfg family=ipv4

1.2)Commands
============
The parameter "cmd=" selects the command inside the family. Each family
will have a set of base commands that it supports

example type the following to get the dump of the supported commands inside a
family

$usr/sbin/nlcfg family=ipv4
[OPT_1]'cmd=flow_add'
[OPT_2]'cmd=flow_del'

type this to select the command
$usr/sbin/nlcfg family=ipv4 cmd=flow_add

1.3)Sub parameters
==================
There are several sub parameters that are required for each command. Also, this
varies between families and also between its commands.

2. IPv4
=======
This is used for programming the IPv4 routing rules to the NSS. This involves programming of
*) Ingress and egress interface name
*) IP address, protocol and port number corresponding to the packet to be routed in
fast path

2.1 Commands Available
======================
The commands that are available can be found typing
"usr/sbin/nlcfg family=ipv4"

For example typing the above command gives the following output.
[OPT_1]'cmd=flow_add'
[OPT_2]'cmd=flow_del'

where the commands are
*) flow add will add the IPv4 fast path routing rule
*) flow del will remove the IPv4 fast path routing rule

2.2 Flow Add
============
The flow add will add rule to the NSS routing module, so that an incoming packet
can route through the fast path or slow path.

2.2.1 Routing Options
=====================
The routing options are
*) "sel_sip:" Source IP address of the packet which is to be routed

*) "sel_dip:" Destination IP address of the packet which is to be routed

*) "sel_proto" Protocol of the packet which has to be routed
	"sel_proto=udp" for clear text UDP packet
	"sel_proto=tcp" for clear text TCP packet
	"sel_proto=esp" for clear text ESP packet

*) "sel_sport" Source port number in L4 header of the packet to be routed.

*) "sel_dport" Destination port number in L4 header of the packet to be routed.

*) "ifname_in" Ingress interface name
	"ifname_in=eth0" if eth0 is the ingress interface
	"ifname_in=ipsectun0" if ipsec tunnel is the ingress interface


*) "ifname_out" Egress interface name
	"ifname_out=eth0" if eth0 is the egress interface
	"ifname_out=ipsectun0" if ipsec tunnel is the egress interface.

*) "iftype_in" Ingress interface type
	"iftype_in=0" for non tunnel interfaces
	"iftype_in=<enum_num>" for tunnel ingress interfaces. <enum_num> is based on the corresponding tunnel defined in the message structure

*) "iftype_out" Egress interface type
	"iftype_out=0" for non tunnel interfaces
	"iftype_out=<enum_num>" for tunnel egress interfaces. <enum_num> is based on the corresponding tunnel defined in the message structure

3. IPv6
=======
This is used for programming the IPv6 routing rules to the NSS. This involves programming of
*) Ingress and egress interface name
*) IP address, protocol and port number corresponding to the packet to be routed in
fast path

3.1 Commands Available
======================
The commands that are available can be found typing
"usr/sbin/nlcfg family=ipv6"

For example typing the above command gives the following output.
[OPT_1]'cmd=flow_add'
[OPT_2]'cmd=flow_del'

where the commands are
*) flow add will add the IPv6 fast path routing rule
*) flow del will remove the IPv6 fast path routing rule

3.2 Flow Add
============
The flow add will add rule to the NSS routing module, so that an incoming packet
can route through the fast path or slow path.

3.2.1 Routing Options
=====================
The routing options are
*) "sel_sip:" Source IP address of the packet which is to be routed

*) "sel_dip:" Destination IP address of the packet which is to be routed

*) "sel_proto" Protocol of the packet which has to be routed
	"sel_proto=udp" for clear text UDP packet
	"sel_proto=tcp" for clear text TCP packet
	"sel_proto=esp" for clear text ESP packet

*) "sel_sport" Source port number in L4 header of the packet to be routed.

*) "sel_dport" Destination port number in L4 header of the packet to be routed.

*) "ifname_in" Ingress interface name
	"ifname_in=eth0" if eth0 is the ingress interface
	"ifname_in=ipsectun0" if ipsec tunnel is the ingress interface


*) "ifname_out" Egress interface name
	"ifname_out=eth0" if eth0 is the egress interface
	"ifname_out=ipsectun0" if ipsec tunnel is the egress interface.

*) "iftype_in" Ingress interface type
	"iftype_in=0" for non tunnel interfaces
	"iftype_in=<enum_num>" for tunnel ingress interfaces. <enum_num> is based on the corresponding tunnel defined in the message structure

*) "iftype_out" Egress interface type
	"iftype_out=0" for non tunnel interfaces
	"iftype_out=<enum_num>" for tunnel egress interfaces. <enum_num> is based on the corresponding tunnel defined in the message structure
