In addition, when you are out of the country, you can use the VPN Service to access the Internet sites or services for which there is a geographic limitation and they are not accessible outside the country. To use the VPN Service, you will need to locate your router through the Internet when you are out of home. There are two ways to do that and the suggested way is to use the Dynamic DNS service. The other way is to locate your router through its public Internet address and it is better to have static IP address settings for the router's Internet  connection. Please make sure you have either the Dynamic DNS service enabled or static IP address settings for your Internet connection.

If you want to access the Internet sites or services with a geographic limitation when you are out of the country, you have to select the option &quot;All sites on the Internet &amp; Home Network&quot;. Please note that once you have selected this option, your VPN client will also access Internet sites and services that do not have a geographic limitation. For an Internet site or service that is normally accessible through the Internet (for example, public networks that do not have a geographic limitation), the access speed through the VPN Service is slower than the access speed without going through the VPN. The &quot;Auto&quot; option will do some intelligence checking and try to use the VPN Service only for necessary accesses (i.e. only for sites or services that are not accessible if not going through the VPN Service), but this is just a best effort function and a correct determination cannot be guaranteed.</p></div></body>"

orbi_terms_of_services_content11="<p>14.2.  <b>Arbitration Rules. </b>Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1- 800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of Your residence, unless You reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If You reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants You an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that NETGEAR made to You prior to the initiation of arbitration, NETGEAR will pay You the greater of the award or One Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00). Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR</p><p>14.3.  <b>Additional Rules for non-appearance based arbitration. </b>If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p><p>14.4.  <b>Time limits. </b>If You or NETGEAR pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p><p>14.5.  <b>Authority of arbitrator. </b>If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of You and NETGEAR, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon You and NETGEAR.</p>"

Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
